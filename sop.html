            -=Player vs Player Protocols=-
            <br><br>
            General
            <br>
            No Plugging. Under normal circumstances, there is NO reason for plugging. We are MECH, we fear nothing. Alt-F4, Exiting out the game, map travel, etc. The only unusual circumstance, is if the game somehow freezes. This is also known as being "hour glassed" in TRO. Being that there is no other option, this is the only time it is acceptable to plug. If you were in a PvP battle and freeze, it is strongly suggested that you contact that person/party and restart the match.
            <br><br>
            Cadets may not PvP under any circumstances. PvP training practices are required for anyone of pvp level. There may be a different level established for solo PvP and group PvP. These levels differ by division.
            <br><br>
            No participating in PvP on the side of the flesh. If you're hunting with a flesh and you both are jumped, kill the opponent that jumped you, but don't actively plan on PvPing with the flesh.
            <br><br>
            Division specific PvP protocols vary too greatly and are far too long to list here. Your Admiral of Training will be able to provide you with all the information you need regarding player vs player combat in your division.
            <br><br>
            -=Chain of Command=-
            <br><br>
            Cadets report to their Drill Sergeant.
            <br><br>
            Drill Sergeants report to the Admiral of Training.
            <br><br>
            Soldiers report to their Flight CO. If a Flight has no CO, they report to their respective Wing Captain. In the absence of a Wing Captain, they report to the Admiral of Training.
            <br><br>
            Commanders report to their respective Wing Captains. In the absence of a Wing Captain, they report to the Admiral of Training.
            <br><br>
            Admirals report to the Grand Admiral.
            <br><br>
            Grand Admiral reports to the Emperor.
            <br><br>
            Judge reports to the Emperor.
            <br><br>
            -=Deactivation=-
            <br><br>
            Failure to abide by the protocols listed in the Charter and SoPs will result in deactivation.
            <br><br>
            If a Unit goes missing for a week without requesting and receiving approval for a Leave of Absence (LOA), the Unit will be listed as Missing in Action (MIA). If that Unit remains inactive for another week, they will be removed from the Empire. Reinstatement will be at the discretion of the Grand Admiral.
            <br><br>
            If you are planning on being inactive for any period of time, a LOA (Leave of Absence) should be requested, and a reason for the LOA should be given along with an estimated time of your return.
            <br><br>
            -=Prototypes=-
            <br><br>
            Prototype Units are to be approved by the Admiral of Purifications and should not be created until approval is given. Before even requesting a prototype, certain criteria must be met. This varies from division to division.
            <br><br>
            On TRO, you may submit a request for a prototype after your main unit reaches max level. When that prototype is max level, you may apply for another.
            <br><br>
            On GW, you may apply for a prototype after you complete one campaign with your main unit. You may make ONE PvP only character, which you may reroll as many times as you like and ONE RP character to play through another campaign. You may only have one PvP only character at any time. You may apply for more RP prototypes upon completing ANOTHER campaign. A completed campaign is defined as playing any of the 3 campaigns in its entirety OR half a campaign + the complete EoTN expansion. Proof of completion must be included in your request for another proto. (Screen shot of final quest, etc.)
            <br><br>
            You are required to submit weekly EWR (Empire Wide Reports) for ALL of your prototype units.
            <br><br>
            (Notice: The rules covering the use of prototypes was officially amended on April 14th, 2008. Any ACTIVE units who already have approved prototypes that do not meet the new criteria will be grandfathered in and allowed to continue playing as usual. Active is defined as being on the roster, in good standing on the above date.)
            <br><br>
            -=Cadets=-
            <br><br>
            All Cadets in the empire will be subject to a two week probation period. During this time, cadets will focus on gaining the required upgrades and studying to pass their scan. Specific information about cadet training in a given division is available on the "Cadet Training" page.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: All past units returning to the empire will also be subject to the above rule and WILL be placed in the cadet pool for the required two weeks. There will be NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule.
            <br><br>
            -=Complaints=-
            <br><br>
            Do not discuss them on Compound. Take all issues with other Units and/or officers to their Commanding Officer immediately. They will handle the issue.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with someone directly under you, reprimand them yourself.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with someone indirectly under you, you may reprimand them yourself, or bring the problem to the attention of their commanding officer.
            <br><br>
            If you're a CO and have a problem with a soldier that is not in your flight, bring it to the attention of their CO.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with a Cadet, take it to their Drill Sergeant.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with a Vice Admiral, take it to their respective Admiral.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with an Admiral, take it to the Grand Admiral.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with the Grand Admiral, take it to the Emperor.
            <br><br>
            If you have a problem with a flesh, kill them. If you can't kill them yet, wait until you can.
            <br><br>
            Unless it directly involves them or is extremely important, the High Council should not have to deal with your problems. Blatant insubordination is grounds for punishment. No matter what an officer did to you, they still should be shown the respect of their station.
            <br><br>
            -=Accounts=-
            <br><br>
            Your Unit's and accounts are your responsibilities. No one is allowed to be on your account other than an approved fellow MECH, and such cases require the Grand Admiral's approval before they are allowed. If another MECH has access to your account, they are to always be /busy and not on any channel, even Compound.
            <br><br>
            It is suggested but not required that you only allow people onto your account when you will be unable to upgrade, and that you change your password as soon as you return.
            <br><br>
            -=Uniforms=-
            <br><br>
            In TRO division, the following items will be considered accent items, and are usually dyed the color of one's flight. Accent items will consist of the following: Bracers, cowl, shield, weapon, baldric, and backpack. Above the soldier rank, GBoNs, NWBoC, Fin Belts, and the like are acceptable in place of a dyed accent item. Other (new) items are to be approved by the Grand Admiral before use.
            <br><br>
            In the GW division, accent colors cannot be changed, so all items will be dyed flight color.
            <br><br>
            High Council
            <br><br>
            High Council members: All items dyed black, and wear only their flight-colored baldric. Text will be flight-colored.
            <br><br>
            Officers
            <br><br>
            For Vice Admirals and all other Officers: Accent items will be dyed flight color, all other items will be dyed black. Text will be flight-colored.
