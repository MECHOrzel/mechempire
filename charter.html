                  <h2>Guild Structure</h2>
                  <p>MECH is a military based guild with a structure of command indicated by rank. Membership is made up of command officers and flights. There are eight flights which make up the Empire. The Grand Admiral and Admirals preside over the entire division.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Expectations</h2>
                  <p>All MECHs will respond to situations in a professional manner. Do not lose your composure as others will often wish to bring out the worst in you. Loyalty to other members and the MECH ideals are paramount. No MECH will ever speak out against another in public.</p>
                  <p>All orders from a superior officer are to be followed. If you are ordered to take an action that is in violation of the Charter or SoPs, follow that order but report the incident to the Grand Admiral as soon as possible.</p>
                  <p>MECH consists of a group of brothers and sisters who share a common goal, eradication of the flesh. Respect is expected of all members and is given in return. MECHs are members of a unique race, all of whom have been fathered by the same means and will be respected as such.</p>
                  <p>MECHs are always to hold their brethren above all lesser beings. The flesh are to be treated like the lesser beings they are. While temporary alliances may be made, it is always to be only for the benefit of the Empire. Hence, MECH shall never permanently merge or join under a group of flesh as the ideals of MECH are to be upheld, respected and never sacrificed.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Deactivation</h2>
                  <p>All of the following are grounds for immediate deactivation or other disciplinary action:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Hacking of any sort will not be condoned</li>
                     <li>Exploiting bugs</li>
                     <li>Scamming</li>
                     <li>Excessive trash talk</li>
                     <li>Excessive OOC statements on compound</li>
                     <li>Insubordination</li>
                     <li>Treason</li>
                     <li>Extended Inactivity</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In some cases such as gross insubordination and treason, a judge will be appointed and the Unit will have the opportunity to defend themselves and their place within the Empire. The High Council will serve as the jury.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Recruitment</h2>
                  <p>The recruitment process is as follows:</p>
                  <p>Individuals desiring purification must have two MECH sponsors and complete an Application for Purification. The Application should be forwarded to the Admiral of Purifications. It will then be reviewed and the sponsors contacted to verify the information provided. The Applicant will be interviewed by the Admiral of Purifications. If approved for purification, the Admiral of Purifications will notify the entire Empire and announce the new Unit. He/she will then notify the recruit that they have been accepted into the Empire and may create their call sign.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Roleplay</h2>
                  <p>The roleplaying of MECH is that of superior beings. Trash talk and harassment are not appropriate for MECHs. As superior beings, we do not feel it necessary to run our mouths at the drop of a hat. We prefer to argue with logic and back ourselves up with action, not easily spoken words. Roleplay brings interest to the Empire and teaches the flesh more about us and our objectives. Roleplay is not a requirement but most practice it as it adds to the enjoyment and mystique.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Call Signs</h2>
                  <p>The correct MECH Call sign is five (5) letters in length. Slang and abbreviations are not acceptable. If you cannot think of a call sign, consult the Admiral of Purifications for suitable suggestions.</p>
                  <p>Created main unit call signs, and prototype call signs, should be considered as yours. If you decide to start playing in a second division, your first call sign created on the new division should be your original main unit call sign. If for some reason your main unit call sign is not available OR you are making your first prototype, you must use your prototype names. No new names shall be created until all of your current names have been used.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Flight Assignments</h2>
                  <p>All new Cadets will be given the Flight descriptions and will be asked to choose three Flights which they feel fit their personality. With approval of the Grand Admiral or Admiral of Purifications the Cadet will be permanently assigned to a flight upon passing their Scan. Each Flight has its own purpose and personality as well as assigned uniform colors. Transferring between Flights is only allowed under unusual circumstances. All transfers must be approved by the Grand Admiral. All MECHs are expected to wear their official uniform at all times. There are no exceptions.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Player vs Player Combat</h2>
                  <p>Player versus Player combat is the primary concern of the Empire. Through PvP our existence is justified and our goals are achieved. It is a way of life, a skill and an art form. All members are expected to follow the basic rules of etiquette regarding PvP. Personal target acquisition/friendships is an important freedom within the Empire. If you do not enjoy or agree with this then you should seek acceptance with another guild.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Ranking Structure and Rank Descriptions</h2>
                  <p>The ranking structure of MECH is as follows:</p>
