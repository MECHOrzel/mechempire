                    Over time, the Flights of MECH have each developed their own unique personality and outlook on the purification of the flesh. Each takes this goal as their own and modifies it to fit their needs, though not to destroy the unity of the Empire as a whole. Though some flights may seem to clash with one another, each member of each flight knows that every MECH plays a part in the domination of the Empire. As the saying from an ancient civilization goes .. "From many, one".. MECH is comprised of many, but MECH is and always will be MECH. United in purpose, united in blood.

                    Cadets will be permanently assigned to a Flight upon passing their Scan and reaching the rank of Soldier. Each Flight has its own assigned uniform colors. Transferring between flights is only allowed under unusual circumstances. All transfers must be approved by the Grand Admiral.

                <p><strong>Napalm:</strong> flammable and volatile substance</p>
                <p><strong>Monks:</strong> devout members of a religious sect</p>
                <p>
                    Always faithful and loyal, the Napalm Monks strive to create a better world for their brethren. Their loyalty is unquestioned. They will always put the lives of their brothers and sisters before that of their own. Though they strike for a peaceful works, the Monks achieve that in a most unusual way. Purification is the means to that end and they use it like the early Christians used the Crusades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their battle cry "the fire cleanses" shows the Monks as fighters and devout religious leaders. Though they may seem fanatical, the Monks are entirely the opposite. Their manner is cool and calm at most times, but extremely volatile when battle nears. They are fierce fighters and protectors.

                <p>
                    The Emerald Falcons are the core of the Empire's armies. Stone cold and lacking emotion, these Falcons prey on those who would stand against the might of the Empire. They are the best of the best; the elite warriors. Where the Napalm Monks strive for perfection of the purified soul, the Emerald Falcons strive for perfection of their honed battle skills. These MECHs are hardly ever seen as they are often out on patrol or on the hunt for foes. The enemy is no match for these swift killers. They are strong and the enemy dies in droves at their hands.

                <p><strong>Shadow:</strong> to hide, follow, spirit/ghost/shade</p>
                <p><strong>Mercs:</strong> mercenaries, underhanded</p>
                <p>
                    To suggest that the Shadow Mercs have no honor would be asking to find yourself with a knife embedded in your spinal cord. Honor means nothing to the Mercs. It is a means to and end, just like everything else they use or disuse. The Mercs have long been used as assassins and spies. Their skill at stealth and subterfuge has no equal in the Empire. They will attain the goals of the Empire by any means necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They seek not valor, for they rarely accept more than a thank you for their efforts. They revel in the hunt and the kill, the steal and the attack, not in the glory received. As long as the Empire flourishes, they will enjoy living in the shadows.

                <p><strong>Scourge:</strong> to afflict, punish severely</p>
                <p>
                    There is a general attitude among the Empire that each flight is the best and above the others in favor to the Emperor or to Gond. Among the Sapphire Scourge, that attitude is indeed present. To say the Scourge are vain would be an understatement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These MECHs are among the most brilliant and creative in the Empire. Research and development is their specialty, but when it comes to war, the Scourge are among the first to reach the front lines and punish any that oppose them. The Sapphire Scourge are the judge, jury and executioner of MECH's foes.

                <p><strong>Malice:</strong> cruelty, ill will</p>
                <p>
                    To call these MECHs humble would be a gross lie. The Malice are the pure warriors of MECH. Shock troops in essence, these MECHs are the first to reach the battlefield and begin the purification or extermination of the flesh. They proudly defend their brothers and are perfectly willing to give their lives to the cause of MECH domination if the need arises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are a thorn in the side of lesser beings. The Malice hold no remorse whatsoever for their actions. They simply do what is best for the Empire. One of the least emotional of flights, they do their job and they do it well. They will go out of their way to purify, as one of the only feelings of enjoyment MECHs experience is that of combat and kill.

                <p><strong>Hawks:</strong> birds of prey, advocates of war</p>
                <p>
                    Any attempt to scour the MECH archives for a war not initiated or instigated by the Fire Hawks would be a fruitless endeavor. These MECHs take purification to an extreme, starting wars with little cause. Only in war lies the true power of the Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Death comes for all who cross the Hawks' path, for they prey on the unsuspecting. At times it becomes difficult to hold back these MECHs. Always ready for action or to start some if there is none to be found. The Emperor must keep these MECHs on a short leash or find the Empire facing every army in the Realm at once.

                <p>
                    An Emperor was once heard saying "Those who are unworthy of assimilation shall be fed to the Demons" and thus, it has become fact. The unworthy and incapable become fodder for the Metal Demons. These fervent MECHs personally take on the obliteration of everything that cannot be assimilated. It is therefore ironic that the Demons make the best trainers.

                <p>
                    Their spirit and skill are models to Cadets and even to some officers. They may enjoy the destruction of the unworthy, but when it comes time for training or when war is declared, they contain their ardor for destruction until ready to be released upon the Emperor's command. Like the Seraphic Malice, they will take orders to the letter and create misunderstandings.

                <p>
                    There has often been mention of a price paid for immortality, for that eternal continuation of the soul. For a MECH, immortality is a truth to be lived as long as there systems stay intact and operational. As long as that remains, the MECH will live forever, but the flesh will not. The Immortals pay a heavy price, none of their humanity remains. The soul, or what's left of it, is buried deep inside the Immortals' metal alloy frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the true androids of MECH. Not a shred of flesh remains, but it is their choice, their longing, to shed their humanity in order to fully purify their soul of the last traces of humanity. Thus, the Immortals have lost touch with all emotion. They are cold and logical, unfeeling and deadly. Death is of no consequence to them and neither is the flesh. All flesh must be consumed by purification.

                <h3>Ninth Flight - Battle Angels</h3>
                <p><strong>Battle:</strong> fierce, aggressive, unyielding</p>
                <p><strong>Angels:</strong> spiritual and celestial beings, superior to man in power and intelligence</p>
                <p>
                    To consider the Battle Angels weak due to the fact that they are entirely composed of female units would surely lead to your demise. The Angels are fearless foes and enemies are often caught off guard by their beauty, and then are slaughtered mercilessly by their steel fury. They are playful and flirtatious, often being known to participate in acts of mischief and pranks. Battle Angels are considered the most fun members of the Empire, often attracting the attentions of other members for their pleasant personalities.

They are extremely professional as their job would require and are very quiet and say little to anyone so as to divulge nothing to compromise the Emperor. They trust no one other than their fellow Dreams.
